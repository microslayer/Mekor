				<li>See the commentators on this verse as to the various ways of interpreting some of the obscure wording in the original Hebrew.</li>
				<li>Deuteronomy 22:9-11.</li>
				<li>See the Mishnah, Tractate Kilayim; Talmud Bavli, Kiddushin 39a; Bechorot 53b, and see there for more references.</li>
				<li>See Bereishit 8:2; Yirmiyahu 37:18, and commentaries.</li>
				<li>Volume 3, 86a. As interpreted by Rikanti on Devarim, ch. 22.</li>
				<li>Most of the laws mentioned here, are to be found and elaborated on in Maimonides’ Yad Hachazaka, Laws of Kilayim.</li>
				<li>According to some, this leniency only applies outside of Israel. See Tur Yoreh Deah, Siman 295, and the Bach and the Beit Yosef on Halachah 3.</li>
				<li>See Sanhedrin 56b; Mishneh Lamelech on the Yad Hachazaka, Hilchot Kilayim, ch. 1, Halachah 6.</li>
				<li>The codifiers debate if this criteria of two species in addition to the grape seed applies also within the Land of Israel. See Tur Yoreh Deah Siman 296.</li>
				<li>Approximately 6.5 feet.</li>
				<li>For the meaning of this word, see Tractate Kilayim, Chapter 9, Mishnah 8, and commentaries.</li>
				<li>Tractate Yoma 67b.</li>
				<li>On Vayikra 19:19.</li>
				<li>Ibid.</li>
				<li>The same explanation with variations appears in various classic commentaries.</li>
				<li>As other commentaries point out (see Zohar and Rikanti mentioned above), this idea is represented in the word “kilayim,” as the original species is being held back from reproducing its own kind, and thereby it is, in a certain sense, expiring and ceasing to exist.</li>
				<li>See Chizkuni on Deuteronomy 22:10.</li>
				<li>See Ibn-Ezra on Deuteronomy 22:10.</li>
				<li>See Rabbeinu Bachaye on Deuteronomy 22:10.</li>
				<li>On Deuteronomy 22:10. </li>
				<li>However, Sefer Hachinuch, Mitzvah 529, does see baal tashchit as having to do with respecting G‑d’screations. </li>
				<li>See also Likutei Diburim Vol 1 p.168. There is much more to be said about the subject of caring for the environment as seen in Torah. This article is limited to what is understood from the commandment of Kilayim. </li>
